Hotel Terrasa Website

Description: My first project for a client, currently paused due to uncertainty on the client's part because of the situation in Russia as the hotel is there. 
Missing hotel info and photos from the client, everything is a placeholder.

The idea was to go for a more playful design with pastel colors. The client did not want a back-end attached as they would be handling the reservations through 
booking.com, their email and telephone.

It was also my first time trying to design a website. For this purpose, I invested a lot of time into learning about SASS, Figma, Adobe XD, mobile-first design, 
responsiveness, design and color basics, basic UX/UI theory.

There are hover effects on the buttons, cards and the carousel. The images in the gallery are clickable and offer a larger view.

It was an amazing learning experience, I'm still not 100% satisfied with the design and I'm still looking for ways to improve it.
